# Git Setup Instructions

## Git is Already Configured! ✅

Your repository is already initialized and connected to:

- **Remote:** `https://github.com/myadsparker/adsparker-official.git`

## Credential Setup ✅

I've configured Git Credential Manager Core which will:

- Show a popup window when you need to authenticate
- Store your credentials securely
- Remember your credentials for future pushes

## How to Push (Easy Steps)

### First Time Push:

1. Run: `git add .`
2. Run: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
3. Run: `git push`
4. **A popup will appear** - Sign in with your GitHub credentials
5. Credentials will be saved automatically

### Future Pushes:

1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
3. `git push` (no popup needed - credentials are saved!)

## Current Git Configuration:

- **User Name:** myadsparker
- **User Email:** myadsparker@gmail.com
- **Credential Helper:** manager-core (Windows Credential Manager)
- **Remote URL:** https://github.com/myadsparker/adsparker-official.git

## Quick Push Commands:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Update: describe your changes"

# Push to GitHub (popup will appear first time only)
git push
```

Your credentials will be stored in Windows Credential Manager and you won't need to sign in again!
