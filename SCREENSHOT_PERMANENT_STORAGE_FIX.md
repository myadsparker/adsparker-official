# Screenshot Permanent Storage Fix

## 🔴 The Problem

**Issue**: Screenshots were being saved with Firecrawl URLs that **expire after a few days**.

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Saving Firecrawl temporary URL
parsingUrl: {
  screenshot: 'https://api.firecrawl.dev/screenshots/xyz123.png'; // Expires!
}
```

**What happened**:

1. User creates project → Firecrawl captures screenshot
2. Firecrawl URL saved to database
3. **After a few days** → Firecrawl URL expires ❌
4. All subsequent API calls fail (no screenshot available)
5. Product extraction, ad generation, analysis - all broken!

## ✅ The Solution

**Download screenshot and save to Supabase Storage** (permanent):

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Permanent Supabase URL
1. Get screenshot from Firecrawl (temporary URL)
2. Download the screenshot image
3. Upload to Supabase Storage
4. Save Supabase URL (permanent)

parsingUrl: {
  screenshot: "https://your-supabase.co/storage/project-files/project-123/screenshots/screenshot-1234567890.png"  // Never expires!
}
```

## 📊 Implementation

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Get Screenshot from Firecrawl

```typescript
const result = await parseUrlWithFirecrawl(websiteUrl);
screenshot = result.screenshot; // Temporary Firecrawl URL
```

#### 2. Download Screenshot

```typescript
const axios = (await import('axios')).default;
const screenshotResponse = await axios.get(screenshot, {
  responseType: 'arraybuffer',
  timeout: 15000,
});

const screenshotBuffer = Buffer.from(screenshotResponse.data);
console.log(`✅ Screenshot downloaded, size: ${size} KB`);
```

#### 3. Upload to Supabase Storage

```typescript
const fileName = `${projectId}/screenshots/screenshot-${timestamp}.png`;

const { data: uploadData, error: uploadError } = await supabase.storage
  .from('project-files')
  .upload(fileName, screenshotBuffer, {
    contentType: 'image/png',
    cacheControl: '3600',
    upsert: false,
  });
```

#### 4. Get Permanent Public URL

```typescript
const { data: publicUrlData } = supabase.storage
  .from('project-files')
  .getPublicUrl(uploadData.path);

permanentScreenshotUrl = publicUrlData.publicUrl;
console.log(
  '✅ Screenshot saved to Supabase (permanent):',
  permanentScreenshotUrl
);
```

#### 5. Save Permanent URL to Database

```typescript
const result = {
  parsingUrl: {
    screenshot: permanentScreenshotUrl,  // ✅ Permanent URL
    description: "Screenshot permanently saved to Supabase Storage"
  },
  ...
};

await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .update({ analysing_points: result })
  .eq('project_id', projectId);
```

## 🎯 Benefits

| Aspect          | Before (Firecrawl URL) | After (Supabase URL)     |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Persistence** | ❌ Expires in days     | ✅ **Permanent**         |
| **Reliability** | ⚠️ Link breaks         | ✅ **Always accessible** |
| **Control**     | External service       | ✅ **Our storage**       |
| **Cost**        | Firecrawl bandwidth    | ✅ **Supabase storage**  |
| **Performance** | External fetch         | ✅ **Direct access**     |

## 📝 Console Output

### Success Case:

```
📋 Step 3: Parsing URL with Firecrawl...
✅ Firecrawl parsing completed successfully
📸 Firecrawl screenshot URL (temporary): https://api.firecrawl.dev/...
💾 Step 3.5: Downloading screenshot and saving to Supabase...
📥 Downloading screenshot from Firecrawl...
✅ Screenshot downloaded, size: 1245.67 KB
✅ Screenshot saved to Supabase (permanent): https://xyz.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/project-files/proj-123/screenshots/screenshot-1234567890.png
📋 Step 4: AI analysis for specific details...
✅ Analyzing points extraction complete and saved successfully!
```

### Fallback Case (if upload fails):

```
❌ Failed to upload screenshot to Supabase: [error details]
⚠️ Using original Firecrawl URL as fallback
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling

The implementation includes graceful fallback:

1. **Download fails** → Use original Firecrawl URL
2. **Upload fails** → Use original Firecrawl URL
3. **Supabase error** → Use original Firecrawl URL
4. **Network timeout** → Use original Firecrawl URL

**Result**: Always have a screenshot URL (even if temporary as fallback)

## 📁 Storage Structure

```
Supabase Storage: project-files bucket

project-123/
  └── screenshots/
      ├── screenshot-1699999999999.png  (First capture)
      ├── screenshot-1700000000001.png  (If regenerated)
      └── ...
  └── products/
      ├── product-1699999999999.png
      └── ...
  └── images/
      ├── freepik-ad-1-1699999999999.png
      └── ...
```

## 🔄 Migration for Existing Projects

For projects created before this fix:

```sql
-- Old projects will have expired Firecrawl URLs
-- When they try to use the screenshot, it will fail
-- Solution: Regenerate analyzing-points to get new screenshot

-- Check if screenshot URL is from Firecrawl
SELECT project_id, analysing_points->'parsingUrl'->>'screenshot' as screenshot_url
FROM projects
WHERE analysing_points->'parsingUrl'->>'screenshot' LIKE '%firecrawl%';

-- To fix: Rerun analyzing-points API for those projects
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test New Project Creation:

1. Create a new project through dashboard
2. Check console logs for:
   ```
   ✅ Screenshot saved to Supabase (permanent)
   ```
3. Verify database has Supabase URL (not Firecrawl URL)
4. Wait a few days and verify screenshot still works

### Verify URL Format:

**Firecrawl URL (OLD - Expires)**:

```
https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/screenshots/abc-123-xyz.png
```

**Supabase URL (NEW - Permanent)**:

```
https://[project-ref].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/project-files/project-id/screenshots/screenshot-timestamp.png
```

## 📊 Impact on Other APIs

All APIs that use screenshots will benefit:

- ✅ `/api/analyze-snapshot` - Uses permanent screenshot
- ✅ `/api/freepik-extract` - Uses permanent screenshot
- ✅ `/api/firecrawl-extract` - Uses permanent screenshot
- ✅ `/api/product-extraction` - Uses permanent screenshot
- ✅ `/api/extract-product-image` - Uses permanent screenshot
- ✅ `/api/projects/[id]/generate-images` - Uses permanent screenshot

**All of these now work indefinitely** - no more expiring URLs!

## 💾 Storage Costs

**Estimate**:

- Average screenshot: ~1-2 MB
- 1000 projects: ~1-2 GB
- Supabase free tier: 1 GB (then $0.021/GB/month)

**Cost**: Minimal compared to having broken screenshots!

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/api/analyzing-points/route.ts`
   - Download screenshot from Firecrawl
   - Upload to Supabase Storage
   - Save permanent URL to database

## Summary

✅ **Problem**: Firecrawl URLs expire after days  
✅ **Solution**: Download + Upload to Supabase  
✅ **Result**: Permanent screenshot URLs  
✅ **Impact**: All screenshot-dependent APIs now work forever  
✅ **Fallback**: Graceful error handling

## Before vs After

### Before:

```
Project created → Firecrawl screenshot URL saved
        ↓
After 7 days → URL expires ❌
        ↓
APIs fail → No screenshot available
        ↓
User experience broken 😞
```

### After:

```
Project created → Firecrawl captures screenshot
        ↓
Download → Upload to Supabase
        ↓
Permanent URL saved ✅
        ↓
APIs work forever → Screenshot always available
        ↓
User experience perfect 😊
```
