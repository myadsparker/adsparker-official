# Exact Product Reference + People in Use Case - Final Implementation

## 🎯 Core Requirement

Generate Facebook ads that:

1. ✅ Show the **EXACT product** from the website (not AI-generated/modified)
2. ✅ Include **people** actively using/interacting with the product
3. ✅ Demonstrate real-life **use case** and benefits

## 🚨 The Challenge

**Problem**: AI models might interpret "reference image" as inspiration and create a similar but different product.

**Solution**: Use MAXIMUM STRENGTH instructions to ensure the reference product is used **EXACTLY AS IS**.

## ✅ Implementation

### Three-Layer Enforcement

#### Layer 1: AI Assistant Instructions (Planning Phase)

Tell the assistant how to structure prompts:

```
**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR REFERENCE IMAGE:**
* Start prompt with: "Using the reference product image EXACTLY AS IS..."
* DO NOT describe product appearance (comes from reference)
* ONLY describe: people, their activity, scene, background, lighting
* Example: "Using the reference product exactly as is, show a young professional woman actively using the product at her desk..."
```

#### Layer 2: Runtime Prompt Enhancement (Execution Phase)

Before sending to Gemini, prepend STRONG instructions:

```typescript
imagePrompt = `🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY:

1. REFERENCE PRODUCT IMAGE (MOST IMPORTANT):
   - A reference product image is attached/provided
   - This reference image IS the actual product from the website
   - You MUST use this EXACT product image AS-IS in the final generated image
   - DO NOT generate a new product
   - DO NOT modify the product
   - DO NOT recreate the product
   - DO NOT change colors, shape, style, design, or any aspect
   - Think of it as COPY-PASTE the product from reference into the scene
   - The product should look IDENTICAL to the reference
   - This is NOT inspiration - this IS the final product
   
2. PEOPLE SHOWING USE CASE:
   - Include 1-2 people from the target demographic
   - Show them actively using/interacting with the REFERENCE product
   - Their hands/body should interact naturally with the product
   - Show the real-life use case and benefit
   
3. SCENE COMPOSITION:
   ${originalPrompt}

🚨 FINAL REMINDER: The reference product is THE REAL PRODUCT. 
Use it exactly - not similar, not modified, EXACTLY.`;
```

#### Layer 3: Gemini 2.5 Flash Reference Images

Send the Base64 product image directly:

```typescript
await fetch('https://api.freepik.com/v1/ai/gemini-2-5-flash-image-preview', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: enhancedPrompt,
    reference_images: [productBase64], // The EXACT product
  }),
});
```

## 💡 How Gemini 2.5 Flash Handles This

### With Reference Images:

**Gemini's Process**:

1. Read reference product image → "This is the product"
2. Read prompt → "Use this exact product + add people + create scene"
3. **Keep reference product unchanged** (composites it into scene)
4. Generate people based on demographic description
5. Generate background/scene based on prompt
6. Composite everything together
7. **Result**: Reference product + AI-generated scene with people

### Technical:

- Reference images use **image-to-image** technology
- Product is **preserved** from reference
- Only scene/people are **generated**
- Final image is a **composite**

## 📊 Expected Results

### Product Page Ad:

**Input**:

- Product: Nike running shoes (from OG image)
- Target: Active millennials

**Output**:

- ✅ **Exact Nike shoes** from reference (same model, color, design)
- ✅ Young woman in athletic wear jogging in a park
- ✅ She's wearing the REFERENCE shoes (not AI-generated shoes)
- ✅ Natural motion, happy expression, outdoor setting
- ✅ Demonstrates use case: running/fitness

## 🛡️ Fallback Strategy

If reference product doesn't appear exactly:

1. **Check reference image quality**: Must be clear, high-res
2. **Check prompt strength**: Are instructions clear enough?
3. **Verify Base64 encoding**: Is image properly converted?
4. **Try different prompt structure**: Rephrase instructions

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/api/freepik-extract/route.ts`
   - Added `inferredAudience` to type definition
   - Enhanced prompt with people use case requirements
   - Maximum strength reference product instructions
   - Both AI assistant and runtime levels updated
